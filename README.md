# Æ’ Function Picker

The Function Picker is a user-friendly plugin designed for Unreal Engine 5. It lets you choose a function for a specific property from any available asset or blueprint. You can either call it directly in your code as a callback, or bind the chosen function to a delegate, eliminating the traditional method of hardcoding the binding by referencing the function directly.
